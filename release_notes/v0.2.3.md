# Release Notes v0.2.3

**Release Date:** December 7, 2025

## Summary

This release implements true bidirectional sync, ensuring your data stays synchronized across all devices regardless of where changes were made.

## New Features

- **Bidirectional Sync**: The `unikortex sync` command now syncs data in both directions:
  - **Pull**: Remote data that is newer or doesn't exist locally is downloaded
  - **Push**: Local data that is newer or doesn't exist remotely is uploaded
  - Uses `updatedAt` timestamps to determine which version wins

## Improvements

- **Better sync output**: The sync command now shows separate counts for pulled and pushed items:
  ```
  Pulled from remote:
    Projects: X
    Entries:  X

  Pushed to remote:
    Projects: X
    Entries:  X
  ```

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue where existing local data was not pushed to remote when sync was first configured
- Fixed issue where running `unikortex sync` only pulled data but never pushed local changes

## How It Works

When you run `unikortex sync`:
1. All remote data is fetched
2. For each project/entry, timestamps are compared:
   - If remote is newer → pull to local
   - If local is newer → push to remote
   - If only exists on one side → sync to the other
3. Relations are synced bidirectionally

This ensures that no matter which device you create or edit entries on, all your devices will have the latest data after syncing.

## Upgrade

```bash
npx @unikortex/cli@0.2.3 sync
```

Or if already installed:

```bash
npm update @unikortex/cli
unikortex sync
```
